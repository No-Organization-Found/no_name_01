# Docsy Example

## Documentation

Docsy has its own user guide (using Docsy, of course!) with lots more
information about using the theme. It is hosted by [Netlify][] at
[docsy.dev](https://docsy.dev). For deploy logs and more, see [Deploys][] from
the site's Netlify dashboard.

Alternatively you can use Hugo to generate and serve a local copy of the guide
(also useful for testing local theme changes), making sure you have installed
all the prerequisites listed above:

```console
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/No-Organization-Found/no_name_01.git
$ cd themes/docsy/userguide/
$ npm install
$ npm run serve
```
